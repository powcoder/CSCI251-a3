This is generated by hand, not by program.
It is illustrative of the type of output associated with
the sequence generation part of the assignment so you can
use it for testing.
It's using Alphabet4, with the mapping in Codons4.txt,
and with data taken from GeneTest4-2.txt
The data length is 120 elements, so two lines of 60
characters per line.

Skipped 3 codons
Sequence 1: Start-Pro-Leu-Ala-Ser-Leu-Ala-Arg-Stop
Contains 7 amino acids.

Skipped 2 codons

Sequence 2: Start-Ser-Iso-Ala-Leu-Stop
Contains 4 amino acids.

Skipped 2 codons

Sequence 3:Start-Ala-Arg-Leu-Leu-Ala-Leu-Ala-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg-Stop
Contains 11 amino acids.

Skipped 5 codons.
End of data.

Check:
Skipped: 3+2+2+5=12
Start/Stop: 3*2=6
In sequence: 7+4+11=22
Total: 40 Consistent with length.
